One of the most\nsignificant impacts to people is the risk of contacting SARS while engaging\ndaily routine activity. In this work we use data from daily underground\nridership in Taipei and daily reported SARS cases in Taiwan to model the\ndynamics of the public underground usage during the wax and wane of the SARS\nperiod. We found that for each reported SARS case there is an immediate loss of\nabout 1200 underground ridership. These loss rates propagate to the following\ndays with an e-folding decay time of about 28 days, reflecting the public\nperception on the risk of contacting SARS disease when travelling with the\nunderground system. About 50% of daily ridership was lost during the peak of\nthe 2003 SARS period, compared with the loss of 80% daily ridership during the\nclosure of the underground system after Typhoon Nari, the loss of 50-70%\nridership due to the closure of the governmental offices and schools during\ntyphoon periods, and the loss of 60% daily ridership during Chinese New Year\nholidays.", 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.2464v1', 'published': '2008-11-15'}

This early RNA hairpin-peptide\ninteraction could have established a reciprocal nucleopeptide replicator that\npaved the way for catalytic translation and replication machineries towards the\norigin of LUCA.", 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14436v1', 'published': '2025-01-24'}

Mixtures of probability\ndistributions, also known as mixed distributions, are an exciting new area for\noptimal quantization. In this paper, we investigate the optimal quantization\nfor three different mixed distributions generated by uniform distributions\nassociated with probability vectors.', 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11063v3', 'published': '2019-08-29'}
