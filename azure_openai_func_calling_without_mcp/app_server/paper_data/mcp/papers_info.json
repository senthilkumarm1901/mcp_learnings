    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with external tools\nthrough standardized interfaces like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). However,\ncurrent MCP implementations face critical limitations: they typically require\nlocal process execution through STDIO transports, making them impractical for\nresource-constrained environments like mobile devices, web browsers, and edge\ncomputing. We present MCP Bridge, a lightweight RESTful proxy that connects to\nmultiple MCP servers and exposes their capabilities through a unified API.\nUnlike existing solutions, MCP Bridge is fully LLM-agnostic, supporting any\nbackend regardless of vendor. The system implements a risk-based execution\nmodel with three security levels standard execution, confirmation workflow, and\nDocker isolation while maintaining backward compatibility with standard MCP\nclients. Complementing this server-side infrastructure is a Python based MCP\nGemini Agent that facilitates natural language interaction with MCP tools. The\nevaluation demonstrates that MCP Bridge successfully addresses the constraints\nof direct MCP connections while providing enhanced security controls and\ncross-platform compatibility, enabling sophisticated LLM-powered applications\nin previously inaccessible environments",

    "summary": "Multi Micro-Channel-Plate Photomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMT) with High\nCollection Efficiency (Hi-CE) MCPs are developed and characterised. With these\nHi-CE MCPs more than 90% of photoelectrons emitted from the photocathode can be\ndetected; this is in contrast to conventional MCPs where about 50% of\nphotoelectrons are lost at the MCP stage. The drawback of the Hi-CE MCPs is a\nsmall degradation of the transfer time spread (TTS). However for applications\nwhere no sub-ns time resolution is required the implementation of Hi-CE MCPs is\nextremely beneficial, as it improves the detection efficiency of the MCP-PMT\nalmost by a factor of two.",

    "summary": "The motivation of this paper is to explore the parameters that affect the\nperformance of Microchannel Plate Photomultiplier Tubes (MCP-PMTs) in magnetic\nfields with the goal to guide their design to achieve a high magnetic field\ntolerance. MCP-PMTs based on two different designs were tested.The magnetic\nfield tolerance of MCP-PMT based on a design providing independently biased\nvoltages showed a significant improvement (up to 0.7 T) compared to the one\nutilizing an internal resistor chain design (up to 0.1 T), indicating the\nimportance of individually adjustable voltages. The effects of the rotation\nangle of the MCP-PMT relative to the magnetic field direction and of the bias\nvoltage between the photocathode and the top MCP were extensively investigated\nusing the MCP-PMT based on the independently biased voltage design. It was\nfound that the signal amplitude of the MCP-PMT exhibits an enhanced performance\nat a tilt angle of $\\pm$8$^{\\circ}$, due to the 8$^{\\circ}$ bias angle of the\nMCP pores. The maximum signal amplitude was observed at different bias voltages\ndepending on the magnetic field strength.",

    "summary": "As Agentic AI gain mainstream adoption, the industry invests heavily in model\ncapabilities, achieving rapid leaps in reasoning and quality. However, these\nsystems remain largely confined to data silos, and each new integration\nrequires custom logic that is difficult to scale. The Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) addresses this challenge by defining a universal, open standard for\nsecurely connecting AI-based applications (MCP clients) to data sources (MCP\nservers). However, the flexibility of the MCP introduces new risks, including\nmalicious tool servers and compromised data integrity. We present MCP Guardian,\na framework that strengthens MCP-based communication with authentication,\nrate-limiting, logging, tracing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) scanning.\nThrough real-world scenarios and empirical testing, we demonstrate how MCP\nGuardian effectively mitigates attacks and ensures robust oversight with\nminimal overheads. Our approach fosters secure, scalable data access for AI\nassistants, underscoring the importance of a defense-in-depth approach that\nenables safer and more transparent innovation in AI-driven environments.",

    "summary": "The development of large language models (LLMs) has entered in a\nexperience-driven era, flagged by the emergence of environment feedback-driven\nlearning via reinforcement learning and tool-using agents. This encourages the\nemergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how\nshould a LLM interact with external services, such as \\api and data. However,\nas MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces\nnew safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are\nnot controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party\nMCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic\nincentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In\nthis position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay\nclose attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop\nnew techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our\nposition, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \\framework, a\ncontrolled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2)\nWe then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks\nin MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial.\n(3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered\nagent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the\nfollowing research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP\nsafety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP\nsafe ecosystem construction. We hope this position paper can raise the\nawareness of the research community in MCP safety and encourage more\nresearchers to join this important research direction.
