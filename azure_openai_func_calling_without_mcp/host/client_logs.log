#### Summary:
The outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 resulted in unprecedented impacts on people's daily life. One of the most significant impacts was the risk of contracting SARS while engaging in daily routine activities. This study uses data from daily underground ridership in Taipei and daily reported SARS cases in Taiwan to model the dynamics of public underground usage during the peaks and decreases of the SARS period. It was found that for each reported SARS case, there was an immediate loss of about 1200 underground ridership. These loss rates propagated to the following days with an e-folding decay time of approximately 28 days, reflecting public perception of the risk of contracting SARS when traveling on the underground system. During the peak of the 2003 SARS period, about 50% of daily ridership was lost, compared to the loss of 80% during the closure of the underground system after Typhoon Nari, and the losses of 50-70% due to closures of governmental offices and schools during typhoons, as well as a 60% loss during Chinese New Year holidays.

#### Summary:
About 4 billion years ago, the Earth probably had the environmental conditions necessary to favor the transition from primitive chemistry to life. Based on a theoretical hairpin duplication origin of tRNAs and their putative peptide-coding capability before ribosomes existed, this work postulates that in this hypothetical environment, Earth's daily temperature cycles could have acted as a unique planetary thermocycler. This mechanism could have facilitated the creation of self-replicating RNA hairpins that simultaneously templated amino acid polymerization in a primordial PCR well of prebiotic molecules. The early interaction between RNA hairpins and peptides could have led to the establishment of a reciprocal nucleopeptide replicator, paving the way for the development of catalytic translation and replication machineries that contributed to the origin of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).

#### Summary:
The central goal of quantization for probability distributions is to reduce the typically uncountable number of values that describe a probability distribution to a finite set, thereby approximating a continuous probability distribution with a discrete one. Mixtures of probability distributions, also referred to as mixed distributions, represent an exciting new area for optimal quantization. This paper explores the optimal quantization for three different mixed distributions generated by uniform distributions associated with probability vectors.
